"""Base upgrade driver interface for multi-vendor support.

This module defines the abstract interface that all upgrade drivers must implement.
Drivers are platform-specific implementations that handle the details of:
- Preflight checks (version, disk space, compatibility)
- File staging (transfer + verification)
- Software installation (activation, commit)
- Post-upgrade verification
- Cleanup of old software

The modular handler architecture uses these drivers to provide consistent
behavior across different vendors and platforms while allowing platform-specific
optimizations.

Supported upgrade modes:
- Install mode: Modern IOS-XE (Catalyst 3K/9K, ISR 4K with install mode)
- Bundle mode: Legacy IOS-XE (older ISR, some ASR) using boot system commands
