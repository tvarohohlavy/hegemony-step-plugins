"""Cisco IOS-XE upgrade workflow step handlers for Hegemony.

Cisco IOS-XE upgrade workflow (preflight/stage/install/verify/cleanup) in
install and bundle modes. Platform-specific by nature: the workflow and its
config schemas encode IOS-XE concepts, so it lives under the cisco.iosxe.*
namespace; other platforms get their own wheels.

Registers under the ``hegemony.step_handlers`` entry-point group; the entry
point name is the claimed handler-id namespace prefix (``cisco.iosxe``).
Handlers reach every platform facility through ``ctx.services``.
