# hegemony-steps-shell

Remote shell execution for Hegemony flows — the `shell.` namespace.

Handlers: `shell.execute` — run commands on Linux/Unix hosts with exec-channel
semantics (meaningful exit codes, separate stdout/stderr), optionally wrapped
in `sh`/`bash`/`pwsh`. The transport (SSH today, WinRM planned) is resolved
from `device.access_config` via the platform's `open_shell` service; per
CONVENTIONS.md, neither transport nor interpreter ever appears in handler ids.

**Opt-in wheel**: not auto-installed with the platform. Install the released
wheel (the demo pins it via `demo-plugin-wheels.txt`) and the handler appears
in the flow editor — this wheel doubles as the reference for out-of-tree
handler plugins.
