"""Upgrade module for firmware/software upgrades.

This module provides:
1. Driver abstraction for multi-platform upgrades (driver.py)
2. Platform-specific drivers (cisco/iosxe_install.py, cisco/iosxe_bundle.py)
3. Modular handlers for upgrade workflow stages (handlers/)

Handlers:
- upgrade.preflight: Pre-upgrade checks
- upgrade.stage: File transfer and verification
- upgrade.install: Execute upgrade (triggers reboot)
- upgrade.verify: Post-reboot verification
- upgrade.cleanup: Remove inactive packages/files

Supported platforms:
- IOS-XE (install mode): Catalyst 9000, ISR 4000 series with install mode
- IOS-XE (bundle mode): Legacy IOS-XE devices using boot system commands

Planned (not yet implemented):
- NX-OS: Nexus 9000/7000/5000 series
- IOS-XR: ASR 9000, NCS series
