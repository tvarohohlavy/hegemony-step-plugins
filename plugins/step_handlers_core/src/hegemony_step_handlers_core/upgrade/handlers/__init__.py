"""Upgrade handlers package.

This package contains modular handlers for each stage of the upgrade workflow:
- preflight: Pre-upgrade checks (version, disk space, file exists)
- stage: File transfer and verification
- install: Execute upgrade (install command or boot system config)
- verify: Post-reboot verification
- cleanup: Remove old packages/files

Each handler can be used independently in flows for maximum flexibility.
