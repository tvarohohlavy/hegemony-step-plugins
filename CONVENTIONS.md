# Handler naming and grouping conventions

Handler ids are a **persistence contract**: they are stored in flow
definitions, git-synced flow YAML, and Temporal run histories. Once released,
an id is renamed only via a coordinated data migration (no legacy alias
resolution exists). These rules keep the taxonomy stable as vendors,
platforms, transports, and libraries multiply.

## Id shape

```text
<namespace-prefix>.<name>
```

- The **namespace prefix** is claimed by exactly one plugin wheel and equals
  that wheel's entry-point name under `hegemony.step_handlers` (e.g.
  `netcli`, `cisco.iosxe`). The host registry rejects ids a plugin registers
  outside its claimed prefix.
- The **local name** after the prefix is normally one snake_case segment.
  Dotted local names are allowed only for a genuine workflow family
  (`cisco.iosxe.upgrade.preflight` … `.upgrade.cleanup`).
- Never derive a handler's group by splitting its id on dots — ownership
  comes from the registry's claimed prefix, and editor grouping comes from
  the handler's `category` metadata.

## Namespace kinds

1. **Capability namespaces** — vendor/protocol-neutral semantics:
   `general`, `probe`, `evidence`, `container`, `flow`
   (and host-owned `monitor` for the in-tree background-monitor family).
2. **Device-interaction paradigms** — protocol families whose config schemas
   differ fundamentally: `netcli` today; `netconf`, `gnmi`, `shell` when they
   exist. A NETCONF edit-config step is not a CLI step with a different
   transport — its config is payload-shaped, so it is a different handler in
   a different namespace.
3. **Vendor-platform namespaces** — only for workflows whose semantics are
   themselves platform-specific: `cisco.iosxe` today; `cisco.nxos`,
   `cisco.iosxr`, `arista.eos` as they appear. Vendor first, platform second.

Third-party plugins claim their own prefix (e.g. `acme.`) and organize
below it (`acme.ipam.allocate`).

## Decision rules for a new handler

Apply in order:

1. **Would the config schema and behavior description read identically for
   another vendor?** Yes → paradigm or capability namespace. No →
   vendor-platform namespace. (This is why `netcli.execute` is not
   `cisco.iosxe.execute_cli`: "send CLI lines, capture output" is
   vendor-neutral — the dialect comes from `device.platform` — while the
   IOS-XE upgrade workflow's install/bundle modes shape its config schema.)
2. **Does it authenticate into a target's management plane, or observe from
   outside?** Outside observation → `probe.` (background variants →
   `monitor.`). Credentialed interaction → a paradigm namespace.
3. **Transports and libraries never appear in ids.** SSH/telnet/WinRM,
   netmiko/scrapli/asyncssh are resolved from `device.access_config` and
   (in the pluggable-transport phase) transport/driver plugins beneath the
   handler layer. Worked example: "run shell commands on a Linux server over
   SSH" is `shell.execute`, **not** `ssh.execute` — if WinRM execution
   arrives later, it is the same paradigm over a different transport, same
   namespace.

## Wheel granularity

One wheel = one namespace prefix = `hegemony-steps-<prefix-with-dashes>`.
Cut wheels along boundaries operators care about (excludable security
surface — e.g. `container` is alone so hardened deployments can omit Docker
execution entirely) and along growth axes (per-platform wheels for
platform-specific workflows). Prefer a new wheel over widening a namespace's
meaning.

## Plugin kinds and their entry-point groups

Step handlers are one of several plugin kinds this repo ships. All kinds
build on `hegemony-step-sdk` and live in **this monorepo** — a transport or
probe wheel is useless without the exact SDK protocol version it implements,
so they release in lockstep with the SDK (this is why they are *not* split
into per-domain repos the way inventory/notification/secret plugins are).

| Kind | Entry-point group | Workspace dir | Wheel name |
|------|-------------------|---------------|------------|
| Step handlers | `hegemony.step_handlers` | `plugins/steps_*` | `hegemony-steps-<prefix>` |
| Device transports | `hegemony.device_transports` | `transports/transport_*` | `hegemony-transport-<name>` |
| Probes | `hegemony.probes` | `probes/probe_*` | `hegemony-probe-<name>` |

The group-name constants live in the SDK next to
`STEP_HANDLER_ENTRY_POINT_GROUP`. The host consumes every kind the same way:
entry-point discovery, a pin in the host's `.github/plugin-pins.json`, and a
release line in the demo's `demo-plugin-wheels.txt` (auto-installed kinds ship
in the images and are omitted from the demo manifest).

### Transports and probes

- **Device transports** implement the SDK `Transport` protocol: `netmiko`
  (default; full surface incl. SCP/HTTP staging), `scrapli` (CLI surface;
  staging raises `NotImplementedError`), and `asyncssh` (exec channels with
  real exit codes, for server-like devices); platform drivers come later.
  They sit *beneath* the handler layer and are selected from
  `device.access_config` — never named in a handler id (see decision rule 3).
  Handlers reach them through `services.connect()` / `services.open_shell()`;
  the host resolves credentials into a `DeviceConnectionSpec` and injects its
  cancellation registry, so a transport wheel stays free of the platform's
  secret pipeline.
- **Probes** implement tcp/icmp/http/dns checks (`hegemony-probe-net`) and are
  consumed by BOTH the one-shot `probe.*` step handlers (via
  `services.run_probe`) and the host `MonitorManager` tick loop — one
  implementation, not a copy in each. A handler's `check_type` is registry-driven
  (the host injects the options from `x_options_source`), so a probe wheel adds a
  check type with no config-model edit.
- The `monitor.*` handlers live in `plugins/steps_monitor` and reach the host
  monitor machinery through `services.start_monitor` / `stop_monitor`;
  MonitorManager and the engine's monitor-node semantics (until-join, run
  cleanup — keyed off the `monitor.` id prefix) remain host forever.
