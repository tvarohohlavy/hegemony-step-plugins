"""Device-transport plugin contract — pluggable device I/O beneath handlers.

A *transport* is the concrete device-connection library (netmiko, scrapli,
asyncssh, …) that satisfies the :class:`Transport` I/O surface. Transports are
pluggable: out-of-tree wheels register under the ``hegemony.device_transports``
entry-point group, each exposing a ``register(registry)`` callable that calls
:meth:`TransportRegistry.register_transport` with a transport class.

The host stays the factory: it resolves credentials, picks a transport by id,
and constructs it from a :class:`DeviceConnectionSpec` — so a transport wheel
never imports the platform's credential resolver, settings, or cancellation
registry. Cancellation of in-flight blocking I/O is threaded through an injected
:class:`ConnectionCancellationRegistry` (the host owns the registry; other host
code cancels through it). The transport never appears in a handler id — which
transport runs is resolved from ``device.access_config``, per CONVENTIONS.md.
