"""Probe plugin contract — outside-observation reachability checks.

A *probe* implements one ``check_type`` (``tcp_connect``, ``icmp_ping``,
``http_health``, ``dns_resolve``, …): given a target address and options it
reports reachability plus metrics, without authenticating into the target.
Probes are pluggable the same way step handlers are — out-of-tree wheels
register under the ``hegemony.probes`` entry-point group, each exposing a
``register(registry)`` callable that calls
:meth:`ProbeRegistry.register_probe` with a probe class.

The host loads probes into its own registry and exposes them two ways: the
background ``MonitorManager`` runs them on its tick loop, and one-shot
``probe.*`` step handlers run them through
:meth:`HandlerServices.run_probe`. A single probe implementation therefore
serves both surfaces — there is no separate monitor-vs-step probe code.

Probe ids are a small **global** vocabulary shared across the whole platform
(they appear in monitor configs and run histories), so — unlike step-handler
ids — they are not namespaced per wheel.
