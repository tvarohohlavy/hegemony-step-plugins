# hegemony-transport-scrapli

Scrapli network-CLI device transport for
[Hegemony](https://github.com/tvarohohlavy/Hegemony).

Registers the `scrapli` transport under the `hegemony.device_transports`
entry-point group — an alternative to the default netmiko transport for the
scrapli core platforms (IOS-XE, IOS-XR, NX-OS, EOS, Junos), running
`AsyncScrapli` over scrapli's asyncssh transport plugin (natively async, no
paramiko in the dependency tree). Implements the SDK `Transport` command
surface (`execute_command(s)`, `execute_command_timing`); file staging
(`scp_put`, `http_transfer`) is not supported by this transport and raises
`NotImplementedError` — use the netmiko transport for staging steps.

The transport is **not** named in handler ids: `netcli.*` and other
credentialed handlers reach it through `ctx.services.connect()`, and which
transport runs is resolved host-side from `device.access_config`
(`access_config.ssh.transport: "scrapli"`). The host resolves credentials into
a `DeviceConnectionSpec` and injects its cancellation registry, so this wheel
never imports the platform's secret pipeline or settings.
