# hegemony-transport-asyncssh

AsyncSSH exec-channel device transport for
[Hegemony](https://github.com/tvarohohlavy/Hegemony).

Registers the `asyncssh` transport under the `hegemony.device_transports`
entry-point group — for server-like devices (Linux hosts, whitebox NOS,
appliances with a real shell) where commands run on SSH **exec channels** with
genuine exit codes, instead of the prompt-scraping network-CLI model netmiko
and scrapli implement. Runs natively async (no thread pool). Implements the
full SDK `Transport` surface: `execute_command(s)` via exec channels,
`execute_command_timing` via a PTY session, `scp_put` via SFTP, and
`http_transfer` by running `curl` on the remote host.

The transport is **not** named in handler ids: `netcli.*` and other
credentialed handlers reach it through `ctx.services.connect()`, and which
transport runs is resolved host-side from `device.access_config`
(`access_config.ssh.transport: "asyncssh"`). The host resolves credentials into
a `DeviceConnectionSpec` and injects its cancellation registry, so this wheel
never imports the platform's secret pipeline or settings.
